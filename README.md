<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Dark Mode Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <button id="toggle-dark-mode">Toggle Dark Mode</button>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is an example of dark mode implementation.</p>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### CSS (styles.css):
```css
body {
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
    transition: background-color 0.3s, color 0.3s;
}

body.dark-mode {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
}
```

#### JavaScript (script.js):
```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const toggleButton = document.getElementById('toggle-dark-mode');
    const body = document.body;

    // Load stored preference
    const darkMode = localStorage.getItem('dark-mode');
    if (darkMode === 'enabled') {
        body.classList.add('dark-mode');
    }

    toggleButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
        body.classList.toggle('dark-mode');
        if (body.classList.contains('dark-mode')) {
            localStorage.setItem('dark-mode', 'enabled');
        } else {
            localStorage.removeItem('dark-mode');
        }
    });

#### 27. Explain how to use the `picture` element for responsive images.

The `picture` element allows you to define multiple sources for an image, enabling responsive design by serving different images based on the viewport size or device pixel ratio.

### Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Responsive Images with Picture Element</title>
</head>
<body>
    <picture>
        <source srcset="image-320w.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)">
        <source srcset="image-480w.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)">
        <source srcset="image-800w.jpg" media="(max-width: 800px)">
        <img src="image-800w.jpg" alt="Responsive Image">
    </picture>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:

- `<source>` elements specify different images for various conditions.
- `srcset` attribute defines the image URL.
- `media` attribute specifies the media query.
- `<img>` element provides a default image if none of the conditions are met.

#### 28. How do you implement a sticky header using HTML and CSS?

A sticky header remains fixed at the top of the viewport as the user scrolls down the page.

### Example:

#### HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Sticky Header Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header class="sticky-header">
        <h1>Sticky Header</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Content goes here...</p>
        <!-- Add more content to enable scrolling -->
    </main>
</body>
</html>
```

#### CSS (styles.css):
```css
.sticky-header {
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
    background-color: #333;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
    z-index: 1000;
}
```

### Explanation:

- `position: sticky;` makes the header stick to the top of the viewport.
- `top: 0;` ensures the header sticks to the top.
- `z-index: 1000;` keeps the header above other content.

#### 30. How do you handle internationalization (i18n) in an HTML application?

Internationalization (i18n) is the process of designing a web application to support multiple languages and regions.

### Steps:

1. **Use Unicode**: Ensure your application supports Unicode.
2. **Locale-Specific Content**: Create content files for each locale.
3. **Language Switcher**: Provide a mechanism to switch languages.
4. **External Libraries**: Use libraries like i18next for managing translations.

### Example:

#### HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Internationalization Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <select id="language-switcher">
        <option value="en">English</option>
        <option value="es">Español</option>
    </select>
    <h1 id="greeting">Hello, World!</h1>

    <script src="i18next.min.js"></script>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### JavaScript (script.js):
```javascript
const resources = {
    en: {
        translation: {
            "greeting": "Hello, World!"
        }
    },
    es: {
        translation: {
            "greeting": "¡Hola, Mundo!"
        }
    }
};

i18next.init({
    lng: 'en',
    resources
}, (err, t) => {
    if (err) return console.error(err);
    document.getElementById('greeting').textContent = t('greeting');
});

document.getElementById('language-switcher').addEventListener('change', (event) => {
    const lng = event.target.value;
    i18next.changeLanguage(lng, (err, t) => {
        if (err) return console.error(err);
        document.getElementById('greeting').textContent = t('greeting');
    });
});

#### 31. Explain the concept and benefits of progressive web apps (PWAs).

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that use modern web technologies to deliver app-like experiences to users.

### Benefits:

1. **Offline Capabilities**: Work offline using service workers.
2. **Installable**: Can be installed on the user's device like native apps.
3. **Responsive**: Adapt to various screen sizes and orientations.
4. **Fast Loading**: Load quickly even on slow networks.
5. **Secure**: Served over HTTPS to ensure security.

### Example:

#### Manifest File (manifest.json):
```json
{
    "name": "PWA Example",

    "theme_color": "#000000",
    "icons": [
        {
            "src": "icon-192x192.png",
            "sizes": "192x192",
            "type": "image/png"
        },
        {
            "src": "icon-512x512.png",
            "sizes": "512x512",
            "type": "image/png"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Service Worker (service-worker.js):
```javascript
self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
    event.waitUntil(
        caches.open('pwa-cache').then((cache) => {
            return cache.addAll([
                '/',
                '/index.html',
                '/styles.css',
                '/script.js',
                '/icon-192x192.png',
                '/icon-512x512.png'
            ]);
        })
    );
});

self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
    event.respondWith(
        caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
            return response || fetch(event.request);
        })
    );
});
```

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Accessible Modal Dialog Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <button id="open-modal">Open Modal</button>

    <div id="modal" class="modal" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="modal-title" aria-hidden="true">
        <div class="modal-content">
            <h2 id="modal-title">Modal Title</h2>
            <p>This is an accessible modal dialog.</p>
            <button id="close-modal">Close</button>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="overlay" class="overlay" aria-hidden="true"></div>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### CSS (styles.css):
```css
.modal, .overlay {
    display: none;
}

.modal[aria-hidden="false"], .overlay[aria-hidden="false"] {
    display: block;
}

.overlay {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

.modal {
    position: fixed;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    background: white;
    padding: 20px;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

#### JavaScript (script.js):
```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const openModalButton = document.getElementById('open-modal');
    const closeModalButton = document.getElementById('close-modal');
    const modal = document.getElementById('modal');
    const overlay = document.getElementById('overlay');

    openModalButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
        modal.setAttribute('aria-hidden', 'false');
        overlay.setAttribute('aria-hidden', 'false');
        closeModalButton.focus();
    });

    closeModalButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
        modal.setAttribute('aria-hidden', 'true');
        overlay.setAttribute('aria-hidden', 'true');

#### 33. How do you implement a grid layout using CSS Grid in an HTML document?

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that allows you to create complex grid-based layouts.

### Example:

#### HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CSS Grid Layout Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="grid-container">
        <div class="item item1">Item 1</div>
        <div class="item item2">Item 2</div>
        <div class="item item3">Item 3</div>
        <div class="item item4">Item 4</div>
        <div class="item item5">Item 5</div>
        <div class="item item6">Item 6</div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

#### CSS (styles.css):
```css
.grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    gap: 10px;
}

.item {
    background-color: #333;
    color: white;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}
```

### Explanation:

- `display: grid;` enables grid layout.
- `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);` creates three equal-width columns.
- `gap: 10px;` sets the gap between grid items.

#### 34. Explain the role of the `Content-Security-Policy` header in securing HTML applications.

The `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) header is a security feature that helps prevent various types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

### Benefits:

1. **Prevents XSS Attacks**: Restricts the sources of script content.
2. **Mitigates Data Injection Attacks**: Limits the sources of data that can be loaded.
3. **Protects Against Clickjacking**: Controls which sites can embed your content.

### Example:

#### HTTP Header:
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src https://example.com; script-src 'self' https://apis.example.com
```

### Explanation:

- `default-src 'self';` allows content only from the same origin.
- `img-src https://example.com;` allows images from `example.com`.
- `script-src 'self' https://apis.example.com;` allows scripts from the same origin and `apis.example.com`.

#### 35. How do you create a CSS custom property (variable) and use it in your HTML document?

CSS custom properties, also known as CSS variables, are entities defined by CSS authors that contain specific values to be reused throughout a document. They can make your CSS more maintainable and easier to read.

#### Creating a CSS Custom Property

To create a CSS custom property, you use the `--` prefix followed by the property name. Custom properties are usually defined within a `:root` selector so they can be accessed anywhere in the document.

```css
:root {
  --main-bg-color: #3498db;
  --main-text-color: #ffffff;
  --spacing: 16px;
}
```

In this example:
- `--main-bg-color` is a custom property for the primary background color.
- `--main-text-color` is a custom property for the text color.
- `--spacing` is a custom property for spacing.

#### Using CSS Custom Properties

To use a custom property, you use the `var()` function.

```css
body {
  background-color: var(--main-bg-color);
  color: var(--main-text-color);
  padding: var(--spacing);
}
```

In this example:
- `background-color` is set to the value of `--main-bg-color`.
- `color` is set to the value of `--main-text-color`.
- `padding` is set to the value of `--spacing`.

### Example: Full HTML and CSS Implementation

Here is a complete example demonstrating how to create and use CSS custom properties in an HTML document.

#### HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>CSS Custom Properties Example</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>This is a paragraph with main text color and spacing.</p>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <p>Footer content here.</p>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

#### CSS (styles.css)

```css
:root {
  --main-bg-color: #3498db;
  --main-text-color: #ffffff;
  --secondary-bg-color: #2ecc71;
  --secondary-text-color: #333333;
  --spacing: 16px;
}

body {
  background-color: var(--main-bg-color);
  color: var(--main-text-color);
  padding: var(--spacing);
  margin: 0;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

header {
  background-color: var(--secondary-bg-color);
  color: var(--secondary-text-color);
  padding: var(--spacing);
  text-align: center;
}

main {
  padding: var(--spacing);
}

footer {
  background-color: var(--secondary-bg-color);
  color: var(--secondary-text-color);
  padding: var(--spacing);
  text-align: center;
}
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Defining Custom Properties**: 
   - Custom properties are defined within the `:root` pseudo-class. This is a special selector that matches the document’s root element and allows you to define global variables.
   - Each custom property is prefixed with `--`.

2. **Using Custom Properties**:
   - The `var()` function is used to retrieve the value of a custom property.
   - Custom properties can be used in any CSS property.

3. **Benefits**:
   - **Reusability**: Custom properties can be reused throughout your CSS, reducing redundancy.
   - **Maintainability**: Changes to custom properties automatically propagate to all instances where they’re used.
   - **Dynamic Styling**: Custom properties can be updated dynamically using JavaScript for responsive or interactive designs.

4. **Fallback Values**:
   - You can provide a fallback value for `var()`, in case the custom property is not defined.

```css
body {
  background-color: var(--main-bg-color, #000000);
}
```

In this example, if `--main-bg-color` is not defined, `#000000` will be used as the background color.

### Conclusion

CSS custom properties (variables) are a powerful feature for managing and maintaining your styles efficiently. By understanding how to create and use them, you can write more modular and scalable CSS.
